## github-action 'r2u-setup'

This action adds [r2u](https://eddelbuettel.github.io/r2u) to an action running Ubuntu 'latest' ([example](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/spotifytop50us/blob/master/.github/workflows/update.yaml)).
It was written for, and used with, Ubuntu 22.04 'jammy' but (by relying on `lsb_release`) should also work for Ubuntu 24.04 'noble' or later.
